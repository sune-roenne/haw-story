#section(The Author's Background)

Sune is a child of the early 1980s and grew up with healthy male role models such as: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and a wholesome feeling of never quite measuring up.
Sune has since the start of the 2010s worked with IT in the Northern European Capital Markets sector, primarily with Net Asset Valuation of investment funds. 
Sune is indeed divorced from a very patient woman and is the father of a smart and beautiful daughter and a smart and sweet (though no longer little) son.
This is about the extent of the similarities to his Basement Prankster namesake.
He (probably) wouldn't know what to do with 100 kg of fertilizer.
