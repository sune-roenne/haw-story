Google search trends tells us, that the term 'Quantum' saw a major rise in popularity around November of 2008 and has since then maintained a popularity about a fifth of what it was at it's highpoint during that final inning of 2008.
I would go so far as to venture, that unless you work in very specific branches of physics or quantum computing, or was involved in the production of the Ant Man installments of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you have a fairly neutral relationship with the concept of quantum. It can therefore be hard to understand how the sentence 'Quantum-Man reclaims' had such a dramatic impact on the young man who had gone to the bathroom to relieve himself, that it sent him running out of the men's room with his trousers and underwaer still around his ankles, but I suppose it was the result of a very enthusiastic enactment by the man in the air ducts - now identifying as 'Quantum-Man - combined with a very unlucky set of circumstances and/or pre-existing conditions with the young man. 
Had it for instance not been for the suspenseful build-up of tension to the scene as Quantum-Man observed his mark through the air-vents and 'de-fumigating evil' in an almost inaudible moan, it is unlikely that the scene would have played out like it did. Had it not been for the uneasy feeling of being watched, looking around the room, thinking he saw what looked like glowing cat eyes through the air vent, dismissing it as the workings of a stressed-out mind, thinking 'there WAS something there' and looking back at the vent to see now very clearly see a set of red eyes encased in a bloody and sweaty face - drool running in a steady stream out of one corner of the mouth only milliseconds before the face erupted in an explosion of: 'QUANTUM-MAN RECLAIMS' and then on this, the first day of easing off benzodiazepines prescribed to him after a stressful event in the companies basement involving organ harvesters, Cecil certainly wouldn't have reacted the way he did. But such were the conditions and such went Cecil storming out of the building for the second time in as many months, naked from the waist down except for the trousers that made his evacuation all the more troublesome. And Quantum-Man went on with his evil ways.

On a chilly Autumn day by the lake of his mind, free from space and time, offset along the V-axis, John has his own things to worry about, most notably the young girl standing knee deep on the other side of the lake, calling for John to join her. This is another one of those scenes that would have most people saying 'Yeah?! What's so bad about that? You should have seen some of the things I have...' and continue on in that annoying fashion, and once again we need to know a little background to appreciate the intensisty of the situation as experienced by John. The thing is, that John had experienced this specific scene at various occasions throughout his childhood, never with a happy ending. If John tried to escape the scene by running away, a mysterious force would pull him back. If he ignored the girl on the other side of the lake, her insisting that he join her would get louder and more intense, until the entire world would resonate with her deaphening shrill skriek. And lastly, if he would venture down into the water and across the lake, which he had done only once, the water would turn to thick blood, the girl would come charging at him, throw her arms around him and pull him down into the bloody swamp with her. In either scenario, he would feel almost frozen by fear, unable to act. Throw in the fact that every previous re-play of this scene had at least been in the setting of a warm summer day and that the setting now had a very cold Autumn wind blowing directly at his face, John's aversion to coming here makes a little more sense.

John stares across the lake to the girl on the other side. It's the same girl. Always the same girl. Pretty in her own right, maybe 17. Around that age. She never changed, even as he got older. He doesn't remember having known anyone that looked like that throughout the course of his life. As usual, her face is locked tight in a weird grimace halfway between a grin and a scream of agony, and although he can't see her eyes from here, he absolutly knows what they will look like... those swirling irises... actually spinning hypnoticingly around in the middle of her eyes. 'No rest for the wicked', 'pursue your destiny John'. John starts walking through the water towards the girl who, as expected, starts running towards him. As she comes closer, John stares into her eyes, and not long before reaching his limit, that point where you have pushed yourself so far beyond the boundaries of what you think you can endure that you accept whatever devil that may take you, he hears... no, not quite hears, but not quite sees either... experiences the... 'essence' may come closest, of Angela. 'Come home John, let go'. And John let's go as the girl in the lake tackles him and pulls him with her into the now seamingly bottomless pool of blood. And for a short moment, John's consciousness let's go in much the same way as when you lay down to take a 15 minute powernap and you get up just before the alarm would have prevented you from actually falling aslep: you haven't slept but somehow both you and the world have changed in those 15 minutes. When John's mind get's up from his power-nap, he is deep underwater... 'underblood' maybe?... Alone in what feels like an endless ocean. But at least the cold is gone... in fact, the gooey substance now feels almost boiling hot, as if he was swiming along the underwater malma-outlets where two tectonic plates meet. And as he only notices after a good long period of time swimming around down here: breathing doesn't seem like something he needs to concern himself with. In fact, the only thing he really feels, is an immense feeling of loneliness. No matter in which direction he looks, there is just an endless amount of more emptyness. In a sense, this is what he had always expected to find when experiementing with psychedelics, and he always attributed that expectation to this weird cartoon produced in the 1970's or 80's, but this is the first time he has come anywhere close to psychedelic underwater tomfoolery. John has an intuition that if he gives into the small voice in the back of his head, telling him that he is going to die alone down here swimming aimlessly around in the vast void, he is going to panic and have a really bad time. John closes his 'inner eyes' and tries to lower his agitation-level, and is at the brink of obtaining a sense of 'oneness' with the void when from some place very far away, he hears his father's sobbing voice. 'My boy! My sweet little boy'. John feels like this is a little much to put on a person at the bottom of the Mariana Trench of an absurdly un-thought-through acid trip, and set's off swimming to escape the awful sobbing voice. And to his amazement he discovers that he can swim really really fast, and zoom through the water like a missile through the sky.

It is while zooming through the void, that he notices a movement out the corner of his eye, and playfully decide to follow it. He is pure electric current traveling seemlessly through the water, in pursuit of lightning. He is in the midst of passing the other bold of lightning when it suddenly grabs him by the arm, sending them both spinning around in the void, as he looks straight into the electrified essence of Angela, her face looking absolutely charged to max-capacity with... MADNESS. And he knows he is too. Pure murderous madness. And they go round and round, daring the void to come at them, moving the endless masses of water along their circular path creating an underwater whirlwind that grows into a vortex that seems capable of draining the void, until they finally fall prey to the forces of their own doing and are swept down the bathtub drain, and John is thrown into the final chapter of his 'jump along he V-axis': the damp and humid castle-corridors of his memory.  

While John is in this way engaged in the humbling experience of seeing himself lost in the vast and boundless void, the man previously known as Albert - now Quantum-Man, is continuing his acts of terror on the 'Upstairs Dwellings'. The story of Quantum-Man - at least, as understood by Quantum-Man himself - is, that he had been quite an ordinary human being when a 'mind-cloud' had killed his friend and made him choose between spending an eternity 'offset by 2 V-units' or channel the will of the 'mind-cloud' into this world, and 'when you put it like that?' Quantum-Man had thought. To alot of people, whether the thumping in the air ducts of the building as he 'flowed inaudably' about was caused by Albert or Quantum-Man was about the same difference; most of the other employees would have found it pretty weird had they known the truth, but many would have been relieved to know that it wasn't the damn 'Rat-problem of 2022' all over again. To Albert however the division was huge, as it allowed him to clear himself of the horrible actions comitted by Quantum-Man. Albert for instance always thought of himself as a kind-hearted and humble soul; sure, he did sometimes dream of smashing the 'Alpha-pricks' from Client Management with a wooden baseball-bat, but since getting to know John, he had realized that this was after all the kiddy-pool of pent up anger. Especially with women, Albert had always gone a long way to please and come off as friendly in a non-creepy manner and wouldn't dream of using his experience with the woman body in all it's shapes and sizes to anything but spreading wellbeing. Quantum-Man however, did not have any moral barriers or behavioural codec keeping him back; when the 'mind-cloud' commanded him to enact the will of the cloud, Quantum-Man obeyed without thought or reason. And as it turns out, this combination of personalities can be a very dangerous thing. Not in the sense of thoughtlessly propping a mass-murderer up on an unknown quantity and combination of hallucinegins and blindly turning your back to him while you tried desperately to jump back along the V-axis, but in the sense that it held a lot of potential for causing a lot of emotional pain.
What Quantum-Man discovered was, that while the 'mad-screaming-maniac-behind-the-air-vent'-approached worked wonders on guys as they were performing their afternoon-disembowlment-ritual, it tended to anger the women more than it made them scared, yelling awful, hurtful things like 'get the fuck out of here you fucking freak' at him. However, the prostitue-previously-known-as-Albert, had a wealth of information to draw on in order to really get at the women in the bathroom. The thing about being a not-particularly-attrictive-male-prostitute was, that most women didn't really feel like they had to maintain any type of facade around him. Combined with the fact that they were paying him, meant that more than a few of his clients had put menu-items such as 'shrink' and 'general physician' on the 'A la carte'-part of Albert's menu, and would happily order from them in-between the appitizer, main dish and the dessert, telling him things like 'I worry a lot about this chunk of fat on my tummy, that I have started wearing a corset, which is horrible in combination with my flatulence', causing Albert to develop - without any conscious effort - the ability to not only have a really good idea of what the women he saw looked like naked, but also which parts of their bodies they felt most unsure about. As Albert had seemingly vacated the premises, this ability now just lay there on the inside of Quantum-Man's skull, waiting to be used to do the mind-cloud's evil bidding. With whispers so faint, that they surely must the be comming from inside the target's own mind, Quantum-Man continued his reign of terror with remarks like: 'they ALL noticed' and 'this skirt totally doesn't hide them'.  

As Quantum-Man is expanding his evil reign of terror, Albert is gone AWOL and Sune sit's trapped by the consequences of his refusal to aknowledge facts, John's situation is unusually dull. He sits, somewhat desillusionate, staring down a long extremely moist corridor, wondering what the hell the reason for bringing him here had been. He had been scared shitless as he stood in the lake of blood being charged by the freakish young woman, but in the same way as getting off the couch and hitting the gym is not something you really want to do but you do it anyways because it's good for you, confronting what had been a lifelong recurring nightmare had seemed like something that needed to be done at one time or another. And eventhough it wasn't something he could really name or pin a definition to, he had realized that the blood in that lake was inevitably tied to him. 
That feeling of being alone in the void was something he knew all too well, and the maddening excitement of not being alone and playing with Angela was something that resonated off the happiest memories of his life. 
But what in the world is THIS about. It's just a long brick corridor. The kind you'd expect any rational 15th century monarch to have built as a last-ditch underground escape route, for use when the peasants revolted against higher taxes, daily whippings or whatever the hell had them all so worked up, and came to exercise their God-given right to mob-led pitch-fork democracy. Except this corridor continued for as far as John could see, with no appearent doors or connecting corridors, but of course John couldn't see that far because it was pitch-black everywhere except for the places where candles lit up small circles of the wall and floor, and these spots where stretched pretty thin along the appearently endless corridor, with large lengths of corridor in complete darkness. From the circles of light closest to him, he could see that at least those circles were covered with blood spatter, but that was about the extend of familiarity this place had to offer. 
It would be wrong to say, that 'John had always been a man of action!', at least, he never really saw himself that way but the same would probably be said about a man of action. 'So alright, maybe I AM a man of action' John thinks and then feels like he get's it a little more right with 'I am not really a man of contemplation', and so far, contemplation was about all John could think of doing down here. His first instinct had off course been to grab a light, and start walking down the corridor, but it had been completely impossible to remove the two candles at the nearest circle of light, from the metal holders fixing them to the wall, and that first circle of light was about as far as he had gone, because that's when the drag became almost inbearable. The thing is, that as John had started walking down the hall, he noticed that his body felt heavier for each step he took, making each step a lot harder to take than the one before. The inverse had been the case when he had walked back to the place he had first entered the corridor and in which he was indeed now once again located.
John get's to thinking back to that one time, where he and his team mates from Football had discovered that the giant bench press rubber bands the heavy-lifters used for working the top-part of their bench press, could be used to shoot at other people. It took two people to operate them: one person had to push one side of the rubber out in-front and overhead of him, while the other person would pull back and eventually release the rubber band, hopefully hitting it's intended target and not the backside of the other man's skull... Although, for the guy in charge of firing the rubber band, both outcomes had felt like sort of a success. John would like to have one of those rubber bands now. 'I wonder if the drag only affects a person's ability to move on his own accord, or if would also slow him down if he could somehow shoot himself from a rubber band down the hall' John is thinking, when he decides that he has had just about enough of this damn contemplative sitting-about and that - rubber band or no rubber band - it is time to DO something. God damn it, John can just sprint at full force down the corridor, and maybe he can outrun the drag. He decides to go for it now, before he has time to think about just how stupid that last notion had been. As it turns out, it ISN'T possible to outrun the drag. Sure, John made it about 3 meters more on this attempt, but now he is stuck in a mid-run 'Heisman-trophy-as-it-would-have-been-looked-had-it-been-created-for-the-special-eds-league'-pose completely unable to move neither forwards nor back.
'This is actually worse than sitting on the floor'. 

If we were to play a game, in which I would ask you to name the arch-nemesis of a person of my choosing, and I were to say: 'Batman', I bet there's a good chance that you would think of 'The Joker'. And if I were to say: 'The Joker', I bet that you would very likely say: 'Batman', assuming a parity in the selection of arch-nemisi, because after all: if you have selected someone to be your arch-nemesis, the least they can do is choose you back, because the fear of rejection and being the only person at the school dance without an arch-nemesis makes the pairing-option the most COMFORTABLE. But it isn't really the most RATIONAL, is it? If we approach the topic from another angle and try to de-clutter and de-mystify the effects of alienating nomencloture like 'villain', 'psychopath' and 'exhibiting-severe-anti-social-traits' or whatever else the psychiatrists subject us to for that prescription, people like 'The Joker' and Lex Luthor are really just assholes. And we know from experiences such as school- and workplace-bullying that assholes will sometimes focus their energy on whoever they deem a sufficiently weak target regardless of whether or not that person is also an asshole or not. Most often though, assholes have a tendency to surround themselves with other assholes: they have asshole friends, asshole colleagues and they have asshole enemies. When looking at the situation in this light, it should come as no surprise, that the arch-enemy of Quantum-Man turned out to be - not a hero who arose in a time of need when employees were being harassed by an unseen (though not entirely UNHEARD) force of evil in the air ducts - but another asshole. An asshole, that Quantum-Man thought of as 'The Shadow Man'.
Albert had always been a realist, and had for instance never really believed in the notion of 'love at first sight', and Quantum-Man couldn't care one way or the other but from the moment he stared down on the dark figure standing in the shadows of the northside 2nd floor bathroom, he knew that he haded the person down there. The setting of this specific bathroom - where a young woman had been stabbed to death a little more than 2 weeks ago - may have added to the intensity Quantum-Man experienced in the room, but he would have haded that ill-lit figure in any setting. It may have happened during aforementioned murder or it may have happened in the ruccus that followed that the wall-lamp had been broken, and nobody had found the time to fix it yet, leaving the small lamp above the handwash miror with the unfathomable task of lighting the entire room. Although it wasn't anything anyone ever said out loud, the shared belief among the staff at FinaLibre was, that it was useless to fix the broken lamp, because nobody was ever going to use that bathroom again (unless a disaster of unimaginable propertions was to occur in the cafeteria-kitchen, and in that case, the poor lighting in the room may turn out to be a blessing). Indeed, after the clean-up crew had finished on the evening following Angela's murder, nobody had been in here. That is: nobody but the man who killed her, 'The Shadow-Man'.
When Quantum-Man first came to the air vent of this bathroom, he had thought the room to be empty, until he noticed the shadow of something that could only be a person, standing still in a dark corner of the room. On top of Quantum-Man's ability to float soundlessly through any confined space, he also had the unusual ability to 'tune his sight', a move of the hands that to the untrained eye would look like someone wiping hair, sweat and/or blood from his eyes. Tuning in on the man, he became able to sense the ghostly glare emitted from the area around the Shadow-Man, replaying Angela's murder for the man's enjoyment, over and over. Well, actually determining that THAT was what he was sensing was of course a little difficult, since Quantum-Man had been blessed with the good fortune of 'radical disco-lights' from the moment of his inception, but if that same spiritual birth had taught him anything, it was that it was perfectly alright to use a little imagination to fill out the dark corners of ignorance. 
Knowing what we know about Albert's build, it's hard to imagine that the Shadow-Man didn't hear Albert moving in on his current position from a long way aways, but for a long time, the dark figure just stands there reveling in the beauty of his past misdeed, even as Quantum-Man starts to growl at the dark figure. And then all of a sudden the figure raises his gaze to the air event, and rays of red-hot microwave light is bombarding Quantum-Man, and the disco-lights all shift to blood red, pounding to the beat of Quantum-Man's cold heart as he realizes that the Shadow-Man means to cook him like oatmeal-pudding in a microwave oven and he let's out a primal scream supposed to be the declaration that 'this shitta is Quantum!' but instead comes out sounding like a hoarse mix between the scream of an angry drunkard before he launches himself into a bar-browl and a person being roasted alive. And then Quantum-Man declares a tactical retreat, zooming through the air-ducts of the building, back to stack up on re-inforcements, back to receive new orders from the mind-cloud.
Frank hadn't really been expecting anyone to be watching him in the bathroom, and to say that Frank knew exactly what had just happened simply wouldn't be true, but Frank had a pretty good idea of who the fat weirdo in the ventilation system was and he knew how to deal with the situation. After all, he had hired the miserable fuck so naturally it was his job to terminate him. Like everything else around here.
Frank looked at himself in the mirror, adjusted his tie, and calmly walked out of the bathroom. 

Sometimes, you have to stand your ground and fight, whether it be a social, symbolic or knuckles-against-bones fight. There are people who will push you as far as possible up into a corner until your only way out of the situation is through them. There are situations where the pillars of the figurative house you call your life is rattled and shaken, and you need to stop running around picking up framed memorabilia and get working on fortifying your home. John didn't do much with living by pre-defined principles or rules, but he did have a lot of ingrained behaviour and reinforced habits. If for instance you put two buttons in front of him - one of them labelled 'violence' - you could be pretty sure that he had pressed whatever button was stained with blood before you had the chance to present him with his options. As such, he finds his current situation, being completely frozen in space, very uncomfortable. As his movement stopped, his body never let go of the tension of running at max-intensity, and it took for the large muscles on the back of the leg to go into spasms, for him to realize that his situation would be much improved if he just let go. 'Relax, and let go'. And so he does, and though he wouldn't wish to be left like this for days, he is pretty sure he'll be alright like this until his kidney and liver has processed enough of the insane mixture he consumed for his brain to start working on an exit-strategy back to reality. As such, John once again finds himself on the brink of coming to peace with himself and his current surroundings, when the damn sobbing returns. It is coming from somewhere very far off, but when you are standing completely still in an unventilated endless hallway, it doesn't take a lot for a sound for it to get under your skin. Luckily for John's sanity - and whoever might be closeby when he returns to the real world if he he had to listen to that damn sobbing until then - John now hears something else: footsteps coming from down the hall. As they get closer, Angela appears at the edge of the darkness of the unlit area in front of him and walks up to him until she is only half a meter from him, tilts her head to one side and looks at him in much the same way a mother would look at a baby who had just painted it's owner face with peanutbutter and says: 'John... You're going the wrong way', and as she says it, he realizes that not only is she right, but 'why had he even thought about going the other way?' And with the realization, comes peace. Peace in the very real and physical sense that he once again regains the ability to move his body freely. Angela takes him by the hand and continue forward, and when they come to Johns previous place of contemplation, the place where the lights stop and the road continue into complete darkness, John stops. Angela, two steps in front of him, turns her head and looks at him as if to ask 'are you coming?' and he says to her: 'I'll be right behind you' and Angela walks on and after her 4th step, John can no longer see her out there in front. Keeping his inner eyes wide open, John walks into the darkness.

- (John) "What's with HookerBoy?"
- (Sune) "..." [putting a hand up to signal to John that he should tread lightly]
  "Quantum-Man" [whispering] 
  "He's sulking because I wouldn't let him have the gun to reclaim the fallen parts of 'Quantum-Land'" [voice slightly raised, as if he was telling another adult what mischiefs the boy had been up to, partly to let the boy know that he had not forgotten about it]
  "I've offered him some sentitives, but he's content with just taking them himself when the 'mind-cloud' has come to avange the unjustice"
- (John) "..." [concentrated look]
  "I think you did that"
- (Sune) "..." [looking thoughtful, then shrugs his shoulders]
  "Maybe"
- (John) "You look peaceful... you don't have that energy of raging insanity radiating off you"
- (Sune) "I'm all cried out"
  "It'll be back... I'm not worried"
  "Did you find Angela?"
- (John) "As much as is possible under these circumstances... given that she's dead and all"
- (Sune) "I'm glad to hear it" [smiling]
  "That you found her that is"

They both sit without moving or saying a word for a couple of minutes. 

- (John) "Look... when Angela came down here to give you the diary..."
- (Sune) "yeah?"
- (John) "Which way did she leave?"
- (Sune) "...?" [not understanding]
- (John) "When she stepped out of your office, did she go right like everyone always does, or did she turn left?"
- (Sune) "..." [looking deep in thought]
  "I think she turned left"
- (John) "What is there to the left?"
- (Sune) "I don't know. I think there's a fire-escape or something. I guess I just figured that that was where the evil circulated in, and mostly just kept it as is"

John get's up, showing clear signs of being lightheaded, struggling to get his body started again.

- (Sune) "We're going out to look at the left. Are you coming?" [directed at 'Quantum-Man']
  "If you keep your yelling and swearing to a minimum, you are allowed to leave the room now"
- (Albert) "..." [not answering, continuing to look straight into the wall of the corner in which he is seated]
- (Sune) "You know where to find us if you change your mind" [making a show of picking up the gun and taking it with him]

- (John) "It's a stairway"
- (Sune) "Who would have thought?"
  "I guess I would have thought, because we are under ground"
  "But I've never been out here before"
- (John) "Doesn't look like cleaning has neither"
  "But someone's been here" [pointing at the foot-prints in the massive dust-pileup] 
  "There is something behind the stairway... Help me get those boxes out?"

When the area beneath the bottom of the stairway has been sufficiently cleared, John opens the 1x1 meter hatch that was concealed by the boxes a minute ago, and steps into the room behind the stairs and turns on the light.

- (Sune) "It's very... spartan"
- (John) "Yes"
- (Sune) "Do you think she made it for the two of you?"
- (John) "Yes"
- (Sune) "Do you think you could have lived down here?"
- (John) "We would have tried" [shrugging his shoulders, turning around to exit the room through the hatch]

Sune turns off the light, and exits the room behind the stairs in time to hear the fire-exit on the floor above slam shut. 

- (John) "Is he going to be alright?" [motioning at the fire-exit he has just seen Quantum-Man run out of]
- (Sune) "..." [seeming to give it some thought]
  "I think so" [nodding]
  "He'll V-shift back before day-light"
- (John) "Shouldn't there be a fire alarm right now?" [once again pointing at the fire-exit]
- (Sune) "She must have disabled it... You guys would need a way to come and go, right?"
  "She was pretty good with electronics. She was cool like that" [smiling]

- (Sune) "She's not the only one who's been down here" [pointing at a set of foot-prints in the dust, too large to belong to either Angela or Quantum-Man]
- (John) "I know"
- (Sune) "Do you think that's why he killed her?"
- (John) "..." [shrugging]
  "I don't care" [looking deadpan into nothing]
- (Sune) "When will you kill him?"
- (John) "Soon..."
  "I have a couple of goodbyes to make"

- (Sune) "..." [looking at John, nodding]
  "Take care John" [walking out of the stairway towards his office]
- (John) "You too"
