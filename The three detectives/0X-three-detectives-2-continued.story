Google search trends tells us, that the term 'Quantum' saw a major rise in popularity around November of 2008 and has since then maintained a popularity about a fifth of what it was at it's highpoint in the final inning of 2008.
I would go so far as to venture, that unless you work in very specific branches of physics or quantum computing, or was involved in the production of the Ant Man installments of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you have a fairly neutral relationship with the concept of quantum. It can therefore be hard to understand how the sentence 'Quantum-Man reclaims' had such a dramatic impact on the young man who had gone to the bathroom to relieve himself, that it sent him running out of the men's bathroom with his trousers and underwaer still around the ankles, but I suppose it was the result of a very enthusiastic enactment by the man in the air ducts - now identifying as 'Quantum-Man - combined with a very unlucky set of circumstances and/or pre-existing conditions with the young man. 
Had it for instance not been for the suspenseful build-up of tension of the scene as Quantum-Man observed his mark through the air-vents and 'vented his stored-up evil' in an almost inaudible moan, it is unlikely that the scene would have played out like it did. Had it not been for the uneasy feeling of being watched, looking around the room, thinking he saw what looked like glowing cat eyes through the air vent, dismissing it as the workings of a stressed-out mind, thinking 'there WAS something there' and looking back at the vent to see a now very clearly set of red eyes encased in a bloody and sweaty face - drool running in a steady stream out of one corner of the mouth only milliseconds before the face erupted in an explosion of: 'QUANTUM-MAN RECLAIMS' and then on this, the first day of easing off benzodiazepines prescribed to him after a stressful event in the companies basement involving organ harvesters, Cecil certainly wouldn't have reacted the way he did. But such were the conditions and such went Cecil storming out of the building for the second time in as many months, naked from the waist down except for the trousers that made his evacuation all the more troublesome. 

On a chilly Autumn day by the lake of his mind, free from space and time, offset along the V-axis, John has his own things to worry about, most notably the young girl standing knee deep on the other side of the lake, calling for John to join her. This is another one of those scenes that would have most people saying 'Yeah?! What's so bad about that? You should have seen some of the things I have...', and once again we need to know a little background to appreciate the intensisty of the situation as experienced by John. The thing is, that John had experienced this specific scene at various occasions throughout his childhood, never with a happy ending. If John tried to escape the scene by running away, a mysterious force with pull him back. If he ignored the girl on the other side of the lake, her insisting that he join her would get louder and more intense, until the entire would resonate with her deaphening shrill skriek. And lastly, if he would venture down into the water and across the lake, which he had done only once, the water would turn to thick blood, the girl would come charging at him, throw her arms around him and pull him down into the bloody swamp with her. In any scenario, he would feel almost frozen by fear, unable to act. Throw in the fact that every previous re-play of this scene had at least been in the setting of a warm summer day and that setting now included a very cold Autumn wind blowing directly at his face, John's aversion to coming here makes a little more sense.

John stares across the lake to the girl on the other side. It's the same girl. Always the same girl. Pretty in her own right, maybe 17. Around that age. Not anyone he remembers having known throughout the course of his life. As usual, her face is locked tight in a weird grimace halfway between a grin and a scream of agony, and although he can't see her eyes from here, he absolutly knows what they will look like... those twisting irises... actually spinning hypnoticingly around in the middle of her eyes. 'No rest for the wicked', 'pursue your destiny'. John starts walking through the water towards the girl who, as expected, starts running towards him. As she comes closer, John stares into her eyes, and not long before reaching his limit, that point where you have pushed yourself so far beyond the boundaries of what you think you can endure that you accept whatever devil that may take you, he hears... no, not quite hears, but not quite sees either... experiences the... 'essence' probably of Angela. 'Come home John, let go'. And John let's go as the girl in the lake tackles him and pulls him with her into the now seamingly bottomless pool of blood. And for a short moment, John's consciousness let's go in much the same way as when you lay down to take a 15 minute powernap and you get up just before the alarm would have prevented you from actually falling aslep: you haven't slept but somehow both you and the world have changed in those 15 minutes. When John's mind get's up from his power-nap, he is deep underwater... 'underblood' maybe?... Alone in what feels like an endless ocean. But at least the cold is gone... in fact, the gooey substance now feels almost boiling hot, as if he was swiming along the underwater malma-outlets where two tectonic plates meet. And as he only notices after a good long period of time swimming around down here: breathing doesn't seem like something he needs to concern himself with. In fact, the only thing he really feels down here, is an immense feeling of loneliness. No matter which direction he looks, there is just an endless amount of more emptyness. In a sense, this is what he had always expected to find when experiementing with psychedelics, and he always attributed that expectation to this weird cartoon produced in the 1970's or 80's, but this is the first time he has come anywhere close to psychedelic underwater tomfoolery. John has an intuition that if he gives into the small voice in the back of his head, telling him that he is going to die alone down here swimming aimlessly around in the vast void, he is going to panic and have a really bad time. John closes his 'inner eyes' and tries to lower his agitation-level, and is at the brink of obtaining a sense of 'oneness' with the void when from some place very far away, he hears his father's sobbing voice. 'My boy! My sweet little boy'. John feels like this is a little much to put on a person at the bottom of the Mariana Trench of an absurdly un-thought-through acid trip, and set's off swimming to escape the awful sobbing voice. And to his amazement he discovers that he can swim really really fast, and zoom through the water like a missile through the sky.

It is while zooming through the void, that he notices a movement out the corner of his eye, and playfully decide to follow it. He is pure electric current traveling seemlessly through the water, in pursuit of lightning. He is in the midst of passing the other bold of lightning when it suddenly grabs him by the arm, sending them both spinning around in the void, as he looks straight into the electrified essence of Angela, her face looking absolutely charged to max-capacity with... MADNESS. And he is madness. Pure murderous madness. And they go round and round, daring the void to come at them, moving the endless masses of water along their circular path creating an underwater whirlwind that grows into a vortex that will drain the void, until they finally fall prey to the forces of their own doing and are swept down the bathtub drain, and John is thrown into the final chapter of his 'jump along he V-axis': the damp and humid castle-corridors of his memory.  

While John is thus engaged in the humbling experience of seeing himself lost in the vast and boundless void, the man previously known as Albert - now Quantum-Man, is continuing his acts of terror on the 'Upstairs Dwellings'. The story of Quantum-Man - at least, as understood by Quantum-Man - is, that he had been quite an ordinary human being when a 'mind-cloud' had blown him and his friend away, and the mind cloud had commanded him to submit to carry out it's plan for the world. He had at first thought: 'hmmm... this is a little strange... and interesting'... then he had thought: 'I don't think the mind-cloud-business is really for me' but then the mind-cloud had sacrificed his friend and made him watch as the poor guy fell to his death, and then the mind-cloud had given him the choice between spending an eternity 'offset by 2 V-units' or gaining the power over love and fear and when you think about it like that, it isn't really a choice, is it? And so now, Quantum-Man was living out the will of the mind-cloud flowing soundlessly through the air ducts - though, just how soundless he had been on that day, there were differing opinions on from people in the offices of FinaLibre.
