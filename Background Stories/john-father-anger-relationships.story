My mother died when I was 4 as she was hid by a drunk driver at 15:30 on a sunny Wednesday afternoon in May, as she was walking the 300 meters from the bus-stop to our house. This could of course be considered a pretty life-changing moment, but I really don't remember enough about my life before her death to have any idea of where I was going before that, and it's hard to know how much it affected me. I have a sense of reckognition and a feeling of warmth when I see photos of her, but those could easily have been imparted on me after her death. For long periods of my childhood, it also became the scapegoat for a lot of my anger: I felt like the world had robbed me of something everyone else had. 
In terms of everyday tangibles, it of course had a huge impact on my life: my mother had worked part-time, so my father could put in more hours at work, and now he was left alone in charge of raising me while also making ends meet. Good thing my mother had been financially responsible enough to insist on life-insurances for the both of them, since it allowed us to keep the hourse and let my did work less, so he could dedicate himself to what he now considered his only important responsibility: to make sure I got through to adulthood. I'm pretty sure he would have killed himself after she died, had he not felt it his duty to take care of me. I guess I'm the only person that can really evaluate his performance, and it may be said that he was competing in a field for which he didn't have much natural talent, but in terms effor he certainly broke the scale.
I was a weird kid, and I didn't make a lot of friends as a child, and it didn't take the other kids in my class long to figure out that I was a pretty shitty playmate when I started elementary school. For the first couple of years, the state of affairs of my social life were kinda bleak: I seldomly played with the other kids neither in school nor after school, but they also pretty much left me alone. That changed sometime during 3rd grade, where the social atmosphere of the class room turned sour; hard to say why, but a gang of 4 boys where almost systematically picking fights with the weakest of us, and it didn't take them long to single me out as the weakest of the herd. 
During the curse of maybe 3 or 4 months, they escalated they attacks from infrequent verbal bombardments to outright punches and kicks when they felt they could get away it, and it really came to a head a week or two before end of the school year, as they jumped me on my way home from school, and really went to work on me, continuing the assault when I was on the ground. I don't know if they stopped out of their own volition or of maybe someone happened to walk by, but I when I came to they were running away and were already some 100 meters away. I felt guilty as I was walking the rest of the way home, determined not to let my father know, feeling like I should have been able to win that fight. This, I couldn't do; he took one look at me and asked me what the hell had happened, and I just broke down, and he picked me up and held me and I cried and tried to tell him about it but couldn't because I cried and he comforted me and I cried until at some point I was done crying. 
When he had heard my story my father did something that I am sure a lot of fathers has done both before and after him: he tried to glue the shattered remains of my world together, by telling me that he loved me and would do anything to help me. And then he did something I doubt many fathers have done: he showed me just what he meant by that. 
He made me list the details of the boys who had jumped me, as he filled out a diagram of little stick-figures complete with details such as height, perceived strengths and weaknesses, including not only the boys themselves, but also family members and known associates. And then we started analyzing different possible courses of action, including any possible course of action. We pretty quickly dismissed the idea of ratting out the boys, as the likelyhood of retaliation was to high. My father having a one-on-one chat with 2 of the parents of the other boys was something we did consider for a long time, but ultimately dismissed as too risky as well. The initiative we leaned towards the most was a lot more drastic though and involved killing the two fathers we deemed most likely to retaliate in the event of their sons taking a serious beating and disposing of their bodies, before singling out the boys 1 at a time and beating them with bats. This might seem like the type of conversation a parent indulge in for their child to "talk it out of their system", but I don't doubt for a minute that he absolutely would have gone through with it. His cool and level-headed way of running through potential courses of action and details in executing them was just to... real! 
In the end, we made the decision not to make a play right now, and instead spend the Summer in preparation; my father had a heavy-bag that he would go a couple of rounds on every evening, and had often asked if would join him, which I had always declined. During that Summer I put in at least 2 hours a day, either on the bag or in one-on-one combat with my father. How much of his teachings had a geniune source in a reckognized martial arts lineage and how much he just came up with and tested out in trial-and-error, I have often wondered, but I never asked him about it. As I got ready for my first day back at school, I felt really good about my chances of beating those 4 punks, even if I ended up having to take them on all at once, but as it turned out things played out very peacefully... I'd go so far as to say: anti-climatic. The parents of the worst of the 4 punks had split up during Summer, and both had moved out of town, and this was appearently enough to completely change the dynamics of not only the remaining 3 punks, but pretty much our entire class. A couple of weeks into the new school year, I got what was probably a very questionable excuse at best for starting a fight with one of the kids that had jumped me during recess, and I really let him have it! I know for a fact that I knocked out 3 of his teeth as I landed punches, elbows, knees and kicks to his head, and I am honestly not sure I would have stopped short of killing him, had I not been dragged away by the two teachers on patrol during that recess. In the end, the whole ordeal got me 2 weeks of suspension, a daily habit of practicing martial arts, absolute confirmation of the length of my fathers support, but most importantly: a whole new outlook on the world. Before that talk with my father, I saw the world as something being run mainly by adults, tugging me along. I now understood, that I was an operator and that I could captain my own ship. It may be that my vessel was small and moved at a low pace, but I could set a course, analyze, evaluate, adjust and by doing so, propel myself along the course.
